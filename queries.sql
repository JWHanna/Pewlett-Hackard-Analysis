-- - The SELECT statement is more specific this time. Instead of an asterisk to indicate 
--   that we want all of the records, weâ€™re requesting only the first and last names of the 
--   employees.
-- - FROM employees tells SQL in which of the six tables to look.
-- - The WHERE clause brings up even more specifics. We want SQL to look in the birth_date
--   column for anyone born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955.
